I want to create a website and application where I can generate QR codes, and each generated QR code displays information about the mice in each cage, including weight, disease, age, number, location, room number, breed, and more. I want the website to have blue and white colors with black text, similar to the Facebook platform. I want this project to have a Success Manager, which would be me, with full access to the website, while the other users would be employees: 1 Director and 1 Manager. All users must log in with their work email and personal password, and they should be able to enter and modify animal data and create QR codes for each cage. However, I want a complete log of every change and addition, including the time, date, and location of the person who made it. I want the application and website to be designed to allow adding or removing features like accessories or images in the future. I also want each QR code to support adding photos or attachments. The platform should be simple to use, with the option to switch languages between English and Spanish. It should send notifications via email and phone (if the user chooses) for updates, changes, or when tasks are assigned to specific employees. On the left side, I want a menu that displays various options, such as a Dashboard, where general information and usage percentages of the application, as well as individual user activity, can be viewed. In that menu, there should also be a "Team" section showing each person using the application within their respective company. Additionally, I want the application to allow the creation of tasks that the Director can assign to employees as needed. The menu should also include a Settings option where users can upload their profile picture, enable or disable notifications, and change their password.
This is the translated request to share with Replit or a developer to ensure itâ€™s built correctly. Let me know if you want me to refine any part or provide a code structure for specific features (e.g., QR generation, authentication, or database schema) to help with the implementation!
